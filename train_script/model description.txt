ml_1.py:
Use raw data, train on 7 layers,learning rate =1e-4

ml_2.py:
Use noise data, train on 6 layers, learning rate 5e-3 and decrease if no improvement of loss.

ml_3.py:
Use raw data, train on 6 layers, same as 2. learning rate = 1e-4

ml_4.py:
Use raw data, train on 6 layers, same as 2. learning rate 5e-3 and decrease if no improvement of loss.

ml_5.py:
Use noise data, train on 6 layers with different length compared to 2. learning rate 5e-3 and decrease if no improvement of loss.

ml_6.py:
Use raw data, same as 4, excep also balance fcnm_RHI.

ml_7.py:
Use noise data, same as 5, excep also balance fcnm_RHI.

ml_8.py:
Use raw data, train on 4 layers. learning rate 5e-3 and decrease if no improvement of loss. Also balance fcnm_RHI.
